"""UPGRADING has to have been looked at for the gateway this image takes.

Most releases ask nothing of a user, so "there is a section per version" would be the wrong
check — it would force an empty entry for every quiet release and teach people to write filler.
What has to happen every time is the *decision*: does this release make someone edit a file they
own? The marker records that the decision was made, and this fails when it has not been.

It went wrong without one. The published sample went four releases without `gw:unlock`, and from
gateway 0.2.19 that leaves a user unable to reach the GitHub API and unable to add a task that
works — because `sgw.sh` is missing `gw-tty` too (sgw-devcontainer-base#27).
