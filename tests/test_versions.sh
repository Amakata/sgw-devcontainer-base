# Every place that names a version agrees with the one place that decides it.
#
# The gateway version is decided by `ARG SEKIMORE_GW_IMAGE` in the Dockerfile: it is where the
# relay binary and the agent guide baked into this image come from. Several other files repeat
# that number for a reader, and repeating it is how it goes stale.
#
# 0.2.27 is why this exists. The gateway had been released as 0.2.32 and upgraded in a project,
# but this image still took 0.2.31, so `sekimore-relay --version` inside a dev container answered
# 0.2.31 and its agent guide never mentioned `refs/pr/<branch>`. Nothing failed: the sample's own
# pins agreed with each other, and no test compared them with the Dockerfile.
#
#   - the sample's compose file pins the same gateway the Dockerfile takes
#   - the READMEs quote that gateway, and say the two are level when they are
#   - UPGRADING's `reviewed-up-to` is that gateway, so a release cannot skip deciding whether it
#     asks anything of the reader
#   - the sample's FROM is a release this repository has written up
#
# It reads files only. That the image really holds the relay it claims is a different question,
# and a build answers it; this one catches the drift that a build would not.
#
# Run it directly: tests/test_versions.sh
