# share/sgw/upgrade.sh against a fake GHCR, a fake raw.githubusercontent.com and a fake gateway
# (sgw-devcontainer-base#44).
#
# `curl` serves fixtures instead of the network, the distributed sgw.sh is a stand-in that logs
# `recreate` and answers `store-status` from a file, and `mise` logs `gw:unlock-auto`. The real
# upgrade.sh is what runs, from a project directory laid out like a real one.
#
# What must not pass, each tried on purpose:
#   - 0.2.9 sorts after 0.2.10 as text; the newest is 0.2.10
#   - moving 0.2.1 → 0.2.10 must leave a ":0.2.19" elsewhere in the file alone
#   - "## 0.2.9 ..." inside a code fence in UPGRADING is text, not a section
#   - a registry that only has older tags must not move a project backwards
#   - the newest tag on the second page of the tag list is still the newest
#   - a distributed file edited by hand is not overwritten
#   - a failed fetch changes nothing
#
# Run it directly: tests/test_upgrade.sh
